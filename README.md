# InfiniteScroll

Currently live at https://joshuanorris.github.io/InfiniteScroll/.

Used Unsplash api to load pictures and created "infinite scroll" user experience... meaning the page will auto-populate once user has reached close to the end of the loaded images. Initially it will only load 5 pictures to help speed of website in case user is accessing with poor internet.

(there is an upper limit of 500 pictures it can show in an hour since I am not paying for the premium unsplash service.)

Used loading.io for loading animation
Used https://unsplash.com/ api for images
